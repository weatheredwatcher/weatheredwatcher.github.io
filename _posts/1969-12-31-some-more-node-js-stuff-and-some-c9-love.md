title: Some more Node JS Stuff (and some c9 love)
---

As you can in all likelihood see, I am spending a bit more time using node js of late.  I've played with it in the past and even blogged a bit about it.  But recently, I've switched my blog to Ghost and a lot of the behind the scene stuff we are doing with one of my side projects is doing a lot more with node.
