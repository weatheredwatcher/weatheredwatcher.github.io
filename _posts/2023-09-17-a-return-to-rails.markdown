So I have been coding in PHP for a pretty long time.  Lately I have been feeling a bit burned out...and I was not sure what was the cause.
I started to rewrite a project I had started on in Symfony using Rails and the source of my burn out became clear!  So I have been throwing my self
back into Rails and I am enjoying it very much!  Stay tuned for more thoughts on my return to Rails as I dive deeper!
