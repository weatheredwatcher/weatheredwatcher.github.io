Well, it's 2020. A new year and a new me....or rather an old me. I am a
newer version of the old me, or maybe an older version of a new me?
Anyway, some things have changed.  I am now,for the first time in a good
many years, back on a Linux Laptop.  This time, I opted for a System76
laptop so that I wouldn't have to spend a million hours of my time
configuring and installing linux, downloading drivers...you know..all
the fun stuff!

This is my first time buying a "Linux" Laptop as opposed to just buying
a consumer laptop, wiping Windows and installing a Linux variant on it.

I decided on System76 for a few reasons.

1. They have a 17" Laptop.
2. They have a custom distro called Pop!_OS that is Ubuntu/Debian based.

So far I have to say, I am very happy!

The box had a fun space theme on the inside. (the box is now a home for
my daughters toy rabbit)

The out of the box setup experience was pretty great as well!

The default WM is Gnome. It's a decent WM, but I am a fan of Awesome WM
personaly, so I took the time to get things setup in a manner that I
liked.  I'll try and post some stuff regarding my setup at a later date.

Basically, I use:

* Awesome WM
* zsh is my shell
* Tmux with custom theme
* Inconsolata with Powerline
* Vim with my own custom setup based on Janus
