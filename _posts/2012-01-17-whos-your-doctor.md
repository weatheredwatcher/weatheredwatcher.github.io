So, as I was putting my daughter to bed tonight, I saw that she had two of my Doctor Who comics on her night stand(#1 and #2).  For those who do not know, the comic is based on the 10th Doctor.  I told  her if she liked Dr Who, when she got a little bit older we could watch it together. She said to me: "Papa, you can keep that old curly man. These are mine!"\nFor reference, she is referring to the fourth Doctor who she saw in flashbacks in later comics.
