Well, the year 2020 is about to come to an end.  And we can hardly wait!
What an absolute fuck fest this year has been! I started out this year
working for a new company....in what became a very toxic environment
very quickly.  I nearly had a heart attack.  Left that company and had
two stients put in, clearing some blockage out of my heart.  A few
months of rehab and medication swapping and I feel better then I have in
at least 5-6 years!  On top of that, I recently started a new job, currently a
contract, at Etsy and I couldn't be happier!  All of this happened in parallel to
Covid-19 and the Election 2020!  My oldest daughter is about to turn 15 and I get to start officially teacher her
how to drive.  She finished her second season of Fast Pitch Softball strong and hopfully she can play in a spring season this time around.
My youngest is 6 and half-way through the first grade. She wants to add gymnastics to the figure skating.
