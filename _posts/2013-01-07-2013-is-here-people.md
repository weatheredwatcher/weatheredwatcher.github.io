Well, it's here.  2013.  We made it!  2012 was a blast, but now we have another year to make plans for and strive for greatness!  I am pleased to say that a majority of my resolutions from last year where meet!  So, in that spirit, I shall now give you all my goals for 2013\n 

  * Learn Node.js 
  * Finish my python VHost app
  * Write a better mysql gui for *nix
  * Become a Debian Developer 
  * Speak even more on php and Open Source
  * Get at least five articles published 
  * Get started on my php book 
  * Switch from CodeIgniter to Lithium

So there it is!  My little wish list for 2013! 

I've install cloud9 ide on my laptop today (if you are wondering, I will blog about it next) and in that is a good start on the Node js.
