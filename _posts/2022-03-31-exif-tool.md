So I still own and use a iPod.  I use gtkpod to manage it.  I ran into an issue though, that when I pull all my songs off the iPod with gtkpod,
I get all the songs just dumped in my music folder with no organization at all.  I like my songs in Album folders under Artist folders.
There is a neat little trick that I thought I'd share on how to get it done.

I use the exif tool to extract the artist and album details from the songs and then loop through them to organize my tunes.


The first pass, I extract the artist and copy all the songs into folder based on the Artist tag.

```exiftool -ext m4a '-Directory<$Directory/$Artist' -r .```

Then I run the command again to pass over all the songs in each Artist folder and sort them into Albums

```exiftool -ext m4a '-Directory<$Directory/$Album' -r .```

This actually works as long as the files are properly tagged...and I have painstakingly tried to keep my library very well tagged!
